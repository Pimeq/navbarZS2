          <h1>Amplexus Mortis</h1>
          Arthur Ford's childhood is unknown, but he was in his thirties during
          the rise of Monogon Industries and MythOS, their simulated universe.
          He presumably pursued an education in cybersecurity due to his later
          profession, and was hired by Monogon Industries to direct security
          efforts regarding their top secret virtual framework, BONEWORKS. At
          his time at Monogon, he befriended a Security Engineer called Hayes,
          and was acquainted with an encryption specialist named Alora B. Ford
          worked on the Museum of Technical Demonstration, approving several
          slides and infographics found in BONELAB. At some point during his
          time at Monogon, Ford became a double agent for a rival company known
          as Gammon. The extent of Ford's work for Gammon is unknown, but he
          committed corporate espionage and sabotage in their name. Ford was
          also privy to the development of BONEWORKS, and learnt about the
          connection between MythOS and the mysterious dimension known as the
          Voidway. He assisted at least partially in the development of
          BONEWORKS, which led him to realize that immortality was possible by
          accessing the Voidway through VR and severing consciousness from the
          body, allowing the mind to exist in the Voidway for eternity.
          BONEWORKS Just before the events of BONEWORKS, Arthur Ford was tasked
          by Gammon to insert a virus into MythOS that causes a crash of the
          servers and leakage of void particles, the mysterious energy that
          keeps the simulation running. Ford barricades himself in a small panic
          room with a hacked headset and a Gammon USB. Inserting the USB, Ford
          enters MythOS with the intention to finally lay his own plans into
          action. Appearing in his offices, Ford performs his daily tasks of
          anomalous object disposal before uploading the virus to BONEWORKS.
          This causes a massive blast that freezes simulated time and boots
          everyone from MythOS, except him. He sneaks out of his office and into
          the adjacent Museum of Technical Demonstration, a virtual tutorial for
          the upcoming MythOS City. Eventually leaving the Museum via a garbage
          chute, Ford explores the business district of MythOS City. Here he
          discovers that the nullmen, AI-generated workers, have become sentient
          and hostile. Fighting them off, he escapes into a factory district,
          where he is contacted by Hayes remotely. Hayes informs Ford that
          MythOS has been placed into quarantine state due to void-particle
          leaks caused by the virus. The nature of the virus is a mystery to
          Monogon, and they believe that it was a simple error caused by the
          System Clock, the heart of the simulation. Hayes requests that Ford go
          to the Time Tower and manually reset the Clock, unaware that Ford is
          the cause of the virus. Ford slips into the runoff trenches and fights
          his way through the Cleanup Crew, a group of holographic soldiers
          dedicated to eradicating the sentient nullbodies. They classify Ford
          as an anomalous object and become hostile to him as well. After an
          arduous battle, Ford falls into the sewers of MythOS City. Here, he is
          contacted by Alora, who has realized the truth. She admits to planning
          to do so herself, and commends him on his initiative. She also
          requests that he leave the gateway to the Void open so that all of
          humanity can use it to become immortal. He also espies a void figure
          watching his progress. Later in the sewers, Ford encounters zombified
          versions of himself, who seem intent on stopping him from reaching the
          Tower. He also discovers the source of the nullbodies' sentience - a
          strange drink called Melon Belly, which is grown from virtual
          watermelons. Ford escapes the Sewers via a warehouse drain, and
          escapes Cleanup Crew onto a train headed to the Tower. The line is
          interrupted by quarantine while at Central Station, and Ford sneaks
          past onto another train. Arriving at the base of the massive Tower,
          Ford battles his way up through several floors to the Time Tower.
          Here, he finds nullbodies worshipping the System Clock. Ford destroys
          the Clock while being swarmed by nullbodies as MythOS begins to
          crumble around him. At the last second, he overloads the System Clock
          and everything disappears as Ford falls into the Voidway.

          <h1>Praesentia Mortis</h1>
          Laus cantici David. Qui habitat in adjutorio Altissimi, in protectione
          Dei caeli commorabitur.<br />
          2 Dicet Domino: Susceptor meus es tu, et refugium meum; Deus meus,
          sperabo in eum.<br />
          3 Quoniam ipse liberavit me de laqueo venantium, et a verbo aspero.<br />
          4 Scapulis suis obumbrabit tibi, et sub pennis ejus sperabis.<br />
          5 Scuto circumdabit te veritas ejus: non timebis a timore nocturno;<br />
          6 a sagitta volante in die, a negotio perambulante in tenebris, ab
          incursu, et daemonio meridiano.<br />
          7 Cadent a latere tuo mille, et decem millia a dextris tuis; ad te
          autem non appropinquabit.<br />
          8 Verumtamen oculis tuis considerabis, et retributionem peccatorum
          videbis.<br />
          9 Quoniam tu es, Domine, spes mea; Altissimum posuisti refugium
          tuum.<br />
          10 Non accedet ad te malum, et flagellum non appropinquabit
          tabernaculo tuo.<br />
          11 Quoniam angelis suis mandavit de te, ut custodiant te in omnibus
          viis tuis.<br />
          12 In manibus portabunt te, ne forte offendas ad lapidem pedem
          tuum.<br />
          13 Super aspidem et basiliscum ambulabis, et conculcabis leonem et
          draconem.<br />
          14 Quoniam in me speravit, liberabo eum; protegam eum,<br />
          quoniam cognovit nomen meum. 15 Clamabit ad me, et ego exaudiam eum;
          cum ipso sum in tribulatione: eripiam eum,<br />
          et glorificabo eum. 16 Longitudine dierum replebo eum, et ostendam
          illi salutare meum.<br /><br />

          Jimmy was originally an NPC for an unknown MythOS simulation
          chamber.[1] He lived in virtual replica of Tempest, Pennsylvania,[1]
          and was the host of a local radio station known as 98.6 KCCM. One day,
          he accidentally exploited a physics bug in the Myth engine and was
          launched far into the air. Afterwards, he explored other bugs, and
          found a love of collision physics and speedrunning. Shunned by the
          players of the simulation, he made his way into the town sewers, where
          he practiced his speed running strategies. After a week in the sewers,
          he accidentally noclipped into a small development room with
          unfinished textures. Here, he found the Avatar Dice, and transformed
          into Fast. He experimented with other avatars, including Strong and
          Short, by focusing on what traits he desired. At some point, he was
          presumably contacted and recruited by Lava Gang, joining their ranks
          in the Voidway. He left his home simulation of Tempest and started
          exploring. He became acquainted with MythOS and the BONEWORKS engine,
          exploring the [REDACTED]Chamber simultaneously to Ford.[2] Advertising
          for his new radio station, 98.6 DeadFM, was placed around MythOS City,
          indicating he was among the members of Lava Gang who infiltrated the
          simulation before opening day, leaving items for Ford. BONELAB As the
          Avatar was being hung in Heaven's Reach, Jimmy teleported a knife to
          them via a bolt of lightning, allowing them to cut the noose and fall
          into Descent. Jimmy observed them through security cameras and
          communicated via radios attuned to his radio station. He expressed
          interest in them and guided them to his recording studio, offering
          them the chance to join Lava Gang. First, he required a test, and gave
          them a Bodylog. After sending them through six simulations to garner
          new avatars and skills, he concluded they were ready for the ascent to
          the Voidway. After the ascent, he broke through the screen ceiling of
          Heaven's Reach with a giant arm and carried the Avatar to the Voidway.
          Here, he greeted them in normal form, driving the Void Cab. After the
          Avatar gets the cab rolling and enters the passenger seat, Jimmy
          begins hosting a new episode of DeadFM. He introduces the Avatar and
          declares their course is set for 'the city'. He then plays Don't Fence
          Me In while driving in circles. He explains the goals of Lava Gang to
          the Avatar and the radio, which can be heard at the beginning of the
          game. After the credits end, Jimmy drops the Avatar off at the Main
          Menu and explains that he has another caller, but will return soon,
          leaving the Avatar to replay BONELAB. Personality Jimmy has a strong
          passion for creation, and believes that creativity is most important.
          He expressed disinterest in metaphysical concepts of what is and is
          not real, stating that what you do is far more important than where
          you are. Development The setting and plot of BONEWORKS fluctuated
          greatly over the course of development. Originally, a premise similar
          to Hall of the Machine King was present, which later changed to a game
          starring Jimmy the VR Hero. However, this too was changed, and
          eventually evolved into the finished game starring Arthur Ford.
          However, Jimmy and other assets were kept for later titles. Concept
          art later revealed for DeadFM featured Jimmy, which led to him being
          the protagonist.
